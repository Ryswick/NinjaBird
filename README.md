NinjaBird
=========

Ninja Bird is a C# game created with Unity. It's a personal version of the Flappy Bird game created by .GEARS Studios.
The game is not finished yet. By now, the player can only launch the game and play until he died. Next versions on the game will include a main menu, a decent game over, personal sprites and probably other features.
