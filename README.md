Ninja Bird
=========

Ninja Bird is a C# game created with Unity. It's a personal version of the Flappy Bird game created by .GEARS Studios.
The game is not finished yet. By now, the player can only launch the game with the main menu and play until he died. Next versions of the game will include a decent game over, personal sprites and probably other features.
