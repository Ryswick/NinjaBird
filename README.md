Ninja Bird
=========

Ninja Bird is a C# game created with Unity. It's a personal version of the Flappy Bird game created by .GEARS Studios.

The goal of the game is to make the best score possible by avoiding the different obstacles which will face your character. The player only need to push the space bar or the left button of the mouse, which give to your character some jump power.

Next versions of the game will include a best score system, more personal sprites and probably other features.
